# UNIX scripting
A scripting file ends in `.sh`  and must start with `#! /bin/bash` to have the system know it's an executable shell file.

To give your file the right permissions, use ` chmod +x test.sh`.

## Syntax
- Variables are in capitals and assign using `=`. The equal sign __cannot__ be surrounded by spaces.
- To take a command as input use `$(command)`, example `$(ls)`.
- To insert a variable within a string, use `"string ${VARIABLE}.`.
- Take user input with `read`, like `read USERNAME`, which declares a variable USERNAME with the user input.
- Predefined variables
  - $@: a list of all arguments
  - $#: the length of that list
  - $1, ... $9: the first nine arguments
  - $?: the exit status of the last executed command
  - $!: the PID of last started process (in the script)
  - $RANDOM: a random positive integer
- Conditions follow a specific syntax of `if [ condition ]` where the spaces around the condition are __required__.
  - File related conditional operators:
    - `-e` file xists
    - `-d` is a directory
    - `-f` is a regular file
    - `-r` is readable
    - `-w` is writeable
  - String related conditional operators:
    - `-n` length of string is not 0.
    - `-z` length of string is 0.
    - `s1 = s2` s1 and s2 are identical strings
    - `s1 != s2` s1 and s2 are not identical strings
  - Integers
    - `i1 -eq i2` integer one is equal to integer two
    - `il -ne i2` integer one is not eqaul to integer two
    - `il -gt i2` integer one is greater than integer two
    - `il -ge i2` is greater then or equal to integer two
    - `il -lt i2` integer one is less then integer two
    - `il -le i2` is less than or equal to integer two
  - Logic operators:
    - `!` not
    - `&&` and
    - `||` or
  - The if expression:
```sh
#! /bin/user

if [ -d /home]
then
    echo "Directory"
fi
```
  - You can also add an elif statement or use an else statement
```sh
#! /bin/bash

if [ -d /home]
then
    echo "Directory"
elif [ -f /home ]
then
    echo "File"
else
    echo "Not specified"
fi
```
- Looping comes in many forms. You have regular looping and conditional looping:
```sh
#! /bin/bash

# Regular looping
for LOOP_VAR in a b c
do 
    echo $LOOP_VAR
done

# Conditional looping
while condition # (until is the counterpart of while and goes on for as long as something is false)
do
    # thing
done
```
- Maths... only works with integers, so no decimals. The syntax is very specific. `((...))`. If you want the have the return value of your expression you also have to prepend a `$`, like this `$((...))`.

## Exercises
- Exercise 4
```sh
#! /bin/bash

if [ -f $1 ] && [ -r $1 ]
then
    cat $1
elif [ -d $1 ]
then
    echo $(ls $1)
fi
```
- Example
```sh
#! /bin/bash

read NUMBER
case $NUMBER
in
    11|12|13)
        echo ${NUMBER}th
    ;;
    *1)
        echo ${NUMBER}st
    ;;
    *)
        echo ${NUMBER}th
    ;;
esac
```
- Exercise 7
```sh
#! /bin/bash

PLAYER_COUNT=$1
INITIAL_NUMBER=$2

while [ $INITIAL_NUMBER -gt 0 ]
do
    for PLAYER_NUMBER in $(seq 1 $PLAYER_COUNT)
    do
        AMOUNT=4
        while [ $AMOUNT -le 0 ] || [ $AMOUNT -gt 3 ] 
        do
            echo "Player $PLAYER_NUMBER, pick 1, 2 or 3"
            read AMOUNT
        done

        INITIAL_NUMBER=$(($INITIAL_NUMBER-$AMOUNT))

        if [ $INITIAL_NUMBER -lt 0 ]
        then
             echo "Player $PLAYER_NUMBER lost"
             break
        elif [ $INITIAL_NUMBER -eq 0 ]
        then
             echo "Player $PLAYER_NUMBER won"
             break
        fi
    done
done
```
